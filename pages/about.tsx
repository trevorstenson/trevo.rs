        Hey, I'm Trevor Stenson.
        <p>I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full stack development</li>
          <li>Web performance</li>
          <li>Natural language processing</li>
        </ul>

          On this blog I write about things that interest me and projects I am working on. In my spare time
          I enjoy juggling, road cycling, skiing, and hiking. I read a lot of
          science fiction. My favorite books include{" "}
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17863">Accelerando</a>{" "}
          and{" "}

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a full stack engineer at <a>Reprise</a> building a
          web platform for infrastructure-less no-code product demos.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, I worked at <a>Smartleaf</a> building an enterprise ruby on
          rails platform for automated tax-loss harvesting. Before that I
          contributed to multiple full stack client projects at{" "}
          <a>Rightpoint</a>.
